### Description

This program is for those of us who suffer from modem-based internet connections, and ISPs who cut the connection at intervals. The program sits in your system tray, and will monitor your dial-up connection. If it drops, the program will automatically dial your chosen connection, and re-establish your internet link (with an optional delay setting - to get round ISPs who allocate a low-speed line if you immediately re-connect). There are quite a few other programs like this on the site, but I didn't see any that did the job quite as simply as this. I hope you find it useful. Happy (slow) downloading!
